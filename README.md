# Twitter-Fav-Follow-bot
This bot interacts with other Twitter users depending on your configuration in the Config.py file. It can favorite tweets and follow users.

To get started:
1. Clone this repository and install the requirements
  ```pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  
 2. Edit the configuration file to your likes and also add your API keys (https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps). The delay between each action is quite high to prevent the account from being banned
 3. Enjoy
